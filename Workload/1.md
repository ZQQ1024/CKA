**Set configuration context $kubectl config use-context k8s. Ensure a single instance of Pod nginx is running on each node of the Kubernetes cluster where nginx also represents the image name which has to be used. Do no override any taints currently in place. Use Daemonset to complete this task and use ds.kusc00612 as Daemonset name.**

**Set configuration context $kubectl config use-context k8s Perform the following tasks: Add an init container to lumpy-koala(which has been defined in spec file /opt/kucc00100/pod-specKUCC00612.yaml). The init container should create an empty file named /workdir/calm.txt. If /workdir/calm.txt is not detected, the Pod should exit. Once the spec file has been updated with the init container definition, the Pod should be created.**

```
```
